## Flower Prediction AI with React 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm ci`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode, and the page will reload if you make edits.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
-> After that your app is ready to be deployed!
